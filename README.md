# Task 1

## Summary

This time Ive redone everything using express and ran into no issues.

The HTML form is in the file called `nameEntry.html`

All the code is in `app.js`

## Pre-requisites

You will need to have node installed

## Set-up

1. Clone the repo
2. Enter the repository and run `npm install` , this will install the project dependencies
3. Finally you can run the project by running `node app.js`

## Future Updates

1. Use an env file to manage ports and custom configs
2. Add proper deployment instructions for production ready version
3. Add tests
4. Use express-validator to validate posted data in the /combine route instead of just the HTML form
